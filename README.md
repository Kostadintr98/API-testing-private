# Online Book Store API Testing

## Project Overview

This project automates the testing of the Online Book Store API using C#. It ensures that all API endpoints, including book and author services, perform as expected by covering various testing scenarios, such as data retrieval, validation, and error handling.

## Key Features

- Automated API tests for book store services.
- Modular, maintainable, and scalable codebase.
- Integration with GitHub Actions for Continuous Integration.

## Key Folders and Files

- **bin/Debug/net8.0/allure-results**: Stores test result files generated by Allure.
- **main/config**: Contains configuration files for test environments.
- **main/models**: Houses models representing API entities.
- **main/requests**: Manages API requests used in the tests.
- **test/api/tests**: Contains all API test cases.
- **test/resources/data**: Holds test data resources.

## Dependencies

- **.NET Core SDK**: Core framework.
- **NUnit**: Unit testing framework.
- **RestSharp**: Library for API requests.

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Kostadintr98/OnlineBookStoreAPITesting.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd OnlineBookStoreAPITesting
   ```
3. Restore the project dependencies:
   ```bash
   dotnet restore
   ```

## Running Tests

To run all tests, use the following command:
```bash
dotnet test
```

## Generating Allure Report

After running the tests, to generate and view the Allure report, use the following command:
```bash
allure serve bin/Debug/net8.0/allure-results
```

## GitHub Actions CI Pipeline

This project is integrated with GitHub Actions for Continuous Integration (CI). The CI pipeline runs tests on every push and pull request to ensure code quality and correctness.

- **Workflow Configuration**: The CI pipeline is configured in the `.github/workflows` folder.
- **Pipeline Tasks**: Automatically restores dependencies and runs tests.
